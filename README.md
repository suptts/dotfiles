Configuring your Linux terminal on GitHub Codespaces

By default, when you get a codespace, youâ€™re given access to a bash shell. However, in recent years, the zsh shell has grown in popularity, with good reason. Zsh supports pretty much everything that bash supports, with several useful additional features: it has much smarter support for tab auto-completion, it includes many commonly used aliases, and it shares command history across active shells. And so much more. 

When the codespace starts up, each file in the dotfiles repo is automatically cloned into /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles.
